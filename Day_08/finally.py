# 1.The finally code block is also a part of exception handling. 
# 2.When we handle exception using the try and except block, we can include a finally block at the end.
# 3.The finally block is always executed, so it is generally used for doing the concluding
# tasks like closing file resources or closing database connection or may be
# ending the program execution with a delightful message.

# One of the important use cases of finally block is in a function which returns a value.

# try:
#     num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# except ValueError:
#     print("Number entered is not an integer.")
# else:
#     print("Integer Accepted.")
# finally:
#     print("This block is always executed.")
